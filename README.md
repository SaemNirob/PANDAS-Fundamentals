# Pandas Notes and Practice (Jupyter Notebooks)

 Pandas is a free Python library that makes it easy to work with and analyze data.
 It has strong data structures, such as Series and DataFrame, that make it easy and quick to clean, transform, combine, and analyze data.

 This repository contains a well-organized set of Jupyter Notebooks you can use to learn and practice with Pandas.
 The notebooks cover everything from loading data to cleaning, categorizing, evaluating, and merging datasets in a step-by-step way.

# Pandas Notes & Practice (Jupyter Notebooks)

This repository contains a structured collection of **Jupyter Notebooks for learning and practicing Pandas**.  
The notebooks cover the complete Pandas workflow — from loading data to cleaning, analyzing, grouping, and merging datasets.

> ✅ Suitable for **Beginner → Intermediate** level Pandas learners

## Notebook Overview (Learning Roadmap)

### 1. Loading Data
- Loading data using `read_csv()`
- Initial exploration with `.head()` and `.info()`

### 2. DataFrame and Series Basics — Selecting Rows and Columns
- Introduction to DataFrames and Series
- Selecting rows and columns
- Using methods like `value_counts()`

### 3. Indexes — How to Set, Reset, and Use Indexes
- `set_index()` and `reset_index()`
- Sorting using indexes
- Understanding why indexes matter

### 4. Filtering — Using Conditionals to Filter Rows and Columns
- Boolean filtering
- Multiple conditions (AND / OR)
- Filtering data based on conditions

### 5. Updating Rows and Columns — Modifying Data Within DataFrames
- Renaming and formatting columns
- Using `map()` and `apply()`
- Updating and transforming values

### 6. Add, Remove Rows and Columns From DataFrames
- Adding new columns
- Removing rows and columns using `drop()`
- Basic structural transformations

### 7. Sorting Data
- Sorting with `sort_values()`
- Sorting by index with `sort_index()`
- Ascending and descending order

### 8. Grouping and Aggregating — Analyzing and Exploring Your Data
- `groupby()` fundamentals
- Aggregation functions (`mean`, `count`, `sum`)
- Using `agg()` for multiple aggregations

### 9. Cleaning Data — Casting Datatypes and Handling Missing Values
- Data type conversion using `.astype()`
- Handling missing values with `dropna()` and `fillna()`
- Data validation using `.info()`

### 10. Data Wrangling — Combining and Merging (Joining)
- Combining datasets using `concat()`
- Merging datasets using `merge()`
- Understanding different join strategies
